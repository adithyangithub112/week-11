## VirusTotal & AlienVault OTX

## Threat Intelligence with VirusTotal & AlienVault OTX

 Overview & Purpose

**VirusTotal** and **AlienVault Open Threat Exchange (OTX)** are two powerful, free, community-driven platforms used by cybersecurity professionals. While both provide threat intelligence, they serve different primary functions. VirusTotal is a multi-engine file and URL scanner for reputation checks, whereas OTX is a platform for sharing and correlating Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) within a wider threat campaign context.

> Key Takeaway: Using these two tools together provides both speed (VirusTotal) in triage and context (OTX) for understanding broader campaigns.

## VirusTotal: The Multi-Engine Scanner

VirusTotal is an online service that analyzes suspicious files, URLs, IPs, and domains. It works by submitting a sample to a wide array of antivirus engines and threat intelligence feeds to get a collective verdict.

1. **What it is:** A free online service that aggregates verdicts from over 70 different antivirus engines and threat feeds.
2. **Why use it:**
    - **Instant Multi-AV Verdict:** Get a quick second opinion on a file or URL.
    - **Public Scanning History:** Check if a file/hash/URL has been seen before without re-uploading.
    - **Threat Intelligence Source:** Access reputation scores, analytics, and community comments.
    - **Incident Response Triage:** Quickly distinguish between known-good and suspicious files.
3. **How to use it:**
    - **Web UI:** Drag and drop a file, paste a URL, or enter a hash directly.
    - **API:** Use the Public or Premium APIs to automate scans and integrate data into SIEM/SOAR tools.
    - **Best Practice:** Always use hash-based queries first to avoid uploading sensitive files.
    
    ## AlienVault OTX: The Community-Driven Intel
    
    OTX is a crowdsourced threat intelligence platform where security analysts share IoCs and threat campaign profiles called **Pulses**. It provides a way to get free, real-time threat data from a global community.
    
    1. **What it is:** A free, crowdsourced threat intelligence platform for sharing IoCs.
    2. **Why it matters:**
        - **Real-time Intelligence:** Get free, up-to-date threat data without a subscription.
        - **Pulse System:** Each Pulse is a package of IoCs tied to a specific threat campaign (e.g., a ransomware group).
        - **API & STIX Feeds:** Easily ingest threat indicators into SIEM, IDS/IPS, and other security tools.
        - **Community Collaboration:** Analysts can share, discuss, and refine threat data.
    3. **How to get started:**
        - **Sign Up:** Create a free account on the OTX website.
        - **Browse/Subscribe:** Search for specific IoCs or Pulses by keywords, or subscribe to campaigns to get alerts.
        - **Integrate API:** Use your OTX API key to feed threat data into your existing security stack.
    
    ## Using Both Tools Together
    
    Both VirusTotal and AlienVault OTX are highly complementary. Combining them provides a more comprehensive view of a threat.
    
    | Use Case | VirusTotal | OTX |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Phishing Investigation** | Submit suspicious URL to get detection ratios and sandbox reports. | Look up the URL's hash or IP to see if it's part of a known Pulse. |
    | **Malware File Triage** | Upload a file to check its global detection and behavioral report. | Cross-reference the file's hash in Pulse feeds to get campaign context. |
    | **Threat Hunting** | Search the API for rare hashes or domain clusters. | Subscribe to a specific Pulse (e.g., "Qakbot campaign") and hunt internal logs for the related IoCs. |
